An increasing demand from millennials for the digital banking experience is quite literally transforming banking as we know it. The consumers of the 21st century desire an omnichannel banking experience which has led to revolutionised banking technology in recent times. 

With an increasing number of new online banks and FinTech’s in the market, competition within the banking industry has never been higher, and mobile banking has become a necessity for banks to remain competitive in the current market. 

Digital banking is the digitisation of traditional banking services and features, therefore eliminating the need for physical branches. Customers can transfer money, apply for loans and more, all from their smartphone at the click of a button, anywhere in the world. Innovations in the likes of blockchain and data analytics allow banks to fine-tune and tailor their online services directly for their customers.

## Who Are JP Morgan Chase?

Chase is a digital banking service offered by JP Morgan, the largest investment bank in the world. Chase Bank will provide money management services and 24/7 customer assistance, and also boasts no fees on opening a UK current account. Through the chase banking app, customers will be able to access their money and other financial services at any time, whilst also having the option to use both physical and digital versions of the chase debit card.

Chase will battle head-to-head with traditional banking giants Barclays, Lloyds, HSBC, and NatWest, as well as the well-established online banks Monzo, Revolut and Starling.

With an enticing rewards scheme that offers cashback on eligible debit card spends, no sign-up fees and no charges on cash withdrawals outside the UK, Chase mean business. Additionally, Chase are going predatory with a 5% interest rate for the first 12 months, way above the historically low interest rate offered by incumbent banks. It is no surprise that Chase Bank are anticipated to contest online banking giants such as the likes of Revolut and Monzo.


## How does Chase Bank compare to other UK online banks such as Revolut and Monzo?

The chase branch already has tremendous backing, currently serving over 60 million US households, with the parent firm holding trillions of dollars in assets, but will it contend with well-established UK online banks? 

Take Monzo for example, the third largest online challenger bank in the UK with 3.9 million users. Monzo also offers free cash withdrawals abroad, 24/7 human support, free signup with no fees, and Monzo also allows you to access your money and other financial services from your phone whenever you like. With this in mind, you may be wondering what makes Chase better than the rest?

### Digital Bank Cards

One quirky USP of Chase is that they offer numberless debit cards, with the account number, card number and sort code stored safely away on the mobile app for maximum security; a huge development in financial technology. If a customer loses their physical card, a new number and digital card can be created instantly, removing the hassle of freezing cards and worrying about someone else using it.

### Budgeting Tools

Users of the Chase Bank can also customise and create multiple current accounts to help them budget. For example, a user could create a supermarket account and only pay for their food shops through this account, allowing users to stay in control of their spending. This is much more advanced than Monzo’s ‘pots’ system, which only allows you to place money into a savings pot and does not directly allow you to choose which account you spend from.

### Too Big to Fail

JP Morgan enters the UK market with one huge advantage; a huge clientele and a wealth of experience, one thing that most UK digital banks are lacking. Not only does the UK have a 71% adoption rate of new fintech companies[[1]](#references) , but as of January 2021, there were 14 million users of digital-only banks; no wonder JP Morgan have made the strategic decision to expand into the UK through Chase. Chase is initially only offering current accounts, but they have plans for the near future to expand into savings, investments, lending and pension products, something that may allow them to dominate the market in the future. Furthermore, their late entry into the UK digital market has allowed them to cherry pick the best features from the leading digital banks, combining these into one superior bank.


I certainly believe Chase will establish itself as one of the leading digital banks in the UK, entering the British market backed by a parent company who forecast their tech budget as $9.4 billion for 2021, and who is more than familiar with the UK market. I would expect Chase to outperform the smaller FinTech start-ups and definitely be competing with Revolut, Starling and Monzo as the UK’s most successful online bank. Upon entry into the UK market with digital bank ‘Marcus’, Goldman Sachs far from struggled to collect deposits, turning away new customers due to a huge surge in demand. From this, I have no doubt JP Morgan will do the same with Chase, not only in the UK, but potentially in Europe too.
