### The rise of BNPL causes concerns for regulators

Ever scrolled through ASOS and found something you really liked, but too expensive? Sometimes those 2:00 am purchases are irresistible because of the “great deal” that expires in an hour despite it being the end of the month. To make these purchases possible, even when you’re on a cash crunch, the financial world has devised a product that has been gaining lots of popularity lately. Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) is a type of short-term financing that allows you to make purchases and pay for them in the future often without any interest.

## What is BNPL?

Names like Klarna and Clearpay might sound familiar. They cater primarily to the BNPL industry with existing company’s like PayPal, Apple and Amazon also entering this space. These providers make the service easy to understand and convenient to use. You will not have to look for the option while shopping, but the option is presented to you by all e-retailers who accept it. Its acceptance is increasing rapidly as it is expected to cover 3% of the global e-commerce spread by 2023. Payments can be made in full in the future or installments and tend to be debited automatically from your account.

## How does it work?

The system mimics the workings of credit cards and EMIs (Equated Monthly Installments). EMI’s are types of BNPL and the difference between BNPL and credit cards is that BNPL is specific to each purchase and is thereby not strict in terms of eligibility which makes it a faster source of finance with extreme transparency.

## Who are the industry leaders?

Afterpay, of Australia, was one of the first to enter the game in 2014. Their success with online retailers got them listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in just two years and in 2018 they made their way into the US market. In August this year, Square, a 2009 founded FinTech mammoth, announced its acquisition of Afterpay.

The rationale behind Afterpay was to cater to the need of millennials who found themselves stuck in compounding debt due to credit cards but still needed credit financing. The simple divide of an item’s price into 4 equal installments attracted people’s attention and with successful payments, the business grew rapidly. E-commerce retailers were also attracted to this system as the terms and conditions required a late fee of $8 followed by $8 weekly charges in case of further defaults.

The way Afterpay makes money was by charging 4-6% of every transaction from the retailers. While that seemed like a hefty price to pay, it also made the sizes of orders and purchases jump from 20% to [50%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2018/07/03/how-a-28-year-old-turned-layaway-for-millennials-into-a-2-billion-business/?sh=72212d359dba). This seemed like a good space to be in and Afterpay weren’t the only players.

Klarna, from Stockholm, founded in 2005 has been booming in the European market by providing the same service. They have recently also tapped into the UK market, with hopes to spread across the globe.

PayPal started Affirm in 2012 offering the same service and now newly also offers a [debit card](https://www.affirm.com/debit) which allows you to split purchases into 4 equal installments, having partnerships with the likes of Amazon.

These global players are at the forefront of the race to be spread all over the world but recently, several smaller countries are watching the emergence of similar BNPL providers on a national scale such as Flipkart Wholesale (number one e-commerce company in India) partnering with Indian fintech Rupifi to offer BNPL services to SMCs.

Several other companies such as Mastercard, Revolut and Monzo have announced that they are currently working on creating this business model and technology on their own and are set to go live soon in 2022. In July, Apple also announced a partnership with Goldman Sachs to allow Apple Pay users to be able to pay for any purchase in 4 installments.

## Will the popularity last?

According to Redburn research company in the UK, the business model that giants like Afterpay and Klarna stand on is not sustainable. However, their valuations by investors have reached extremely high numbers such as Afterpay being acquired for $29 billion in less than 10 years of its inception. These valuations are high, however, if you look deeper, these companies aren’t actually making any money. Well then why are the valuations high?

Despite BNPL companies making small margins on high volumes, their business model doesn’t allow them to reach high profits. Nonetheless, their customer acquisition rate is extremely high, positioning them well to be acquired by a bigger, more profitable bank or FinTech company to gain market share. Companies will pay top dollar for these clients, a potential reason for high valuations.

Alongside the rapidly increasing consumer base, the lack of regulation in this space also makes it attractive for business owners as well as investors. However, this is expected to change soon as this cycle is seen by every credit product. With the lack of credit checks needed for BNPL, consumer exploitation is at the forefront of regulators’ minds.

While the talk has been all about BNPL companies, their investors and e-commerce retailers, what about the customers? Is this financial product a healthy treat for investor behavior? Or is it a curse by allowing consumers to delve into expensive buys by considering themselves more financially able than they are? A reflection on the behavioral change is necessary and I truly believe it will be the deciding force of this service’s long-term success.
