## How Fintech is Increasing the Opportunity for ‘Financial Gurus’ to Exploit Retail Traders 

As fintech becomes more accessible to people across the world the power to steal from the poor becomes greater. Given technology can become complicated, those without knowledge fall victim to many scams, being promised the riches but given nothing but an empty wallet. Whether it’s individuals using Bitcoin as a means of masking their identity, trading experts promising a return on investment (ROI) higher than the average hedge fund, or being taught get rich quick methods, 90% of people get left in the dirt. Fintech is always growing; the more it grows, the more vulnerable we become. Here is a brief insight into such activities and how to avoid them. 

### Margin call. Trading gurus and brokers. 

Finance gurus are only gurus in one thing – marketing. These ‘gurus’ fake their expertise within specific niches to gain a following of uneducated people who don't understand the niche. They then drain the capital from the pockets of these innocent people teaching them basic or nonsense knowledge that is usually free on the internet. These people often buy fake social media followings and spend money on advertisements to lure people in with fake proof of earnings for them to herd in the sheeple who don't understand the financial markets. They lure people into a false sense of security with time being of the essence, they convince them if they don’t invest now, FOMO will start to kick in.

### Foreign exchange market and faking trade history. 

In the forex market, various variables can hinder the trading performance of any rookie trader. First are bad brokers. These scam brokers will stop hunting, manipulate instrument pricing to take your money and then drop it back to your initial bias, manipulate instrument pricing compared to other brokers to ensure the loss of retail traders, or flat out just take the money from the trader’s account whether it be by opening an unauthorised trade or by just taking the money and blaming it on a glitch. Next are marketers. These MLM (Multilevel Marketing) companies and groups flex their rented riches to lure people into their guru world. They will make retail traders pay a monthly fee while not caring whether they profit from their signals; showing no fruits to their labour. Some marketers go out of their way to fake their proof of earnings by forging fake MT4 or MyFXBook accounts (trading accounts). 

Another phenomenon that constantly catches retail traders is wick-off, in which either the broker or the market somewhat reverses the price of an instrument by pumping the price in either direction and then retracting. This fools retailer investors into buying high and selling low, causing them to close and lose money. ‘Price action’ and ‘price rejection’ are also major factors in trading. With the rise of fintech allowing investors to trade at a click of a button on their smartphone, the vulnerable are only becoming easier and easier targets. 

It is disrespectful and fake for scammers to keep doing this. There needs to be more accountability and regulation around these scammers. Portfolios don't need to be six figures, and most of the profits are achieved from a demo account! Either way, few scammers have got what they claim, and they'll do anything to try and pretend they do have an edge in the market, such as a big bank balance. All the cars, all the rentals, and all the cash in the world won't show anyone you've made it trading or even can. This naivety is what they prey off, however, eventually people will realise anyone with money can claim to do this. The issue is when they want to see results and the claim of an edge surface: it all falls to nothing. At that point, everyone realises how cheap and far from the truth any fancy screenshot is. Millions of people are falling for these scams, 14,079 investment scams were reported to the FTC in the first quarter of 2021, and victims lost $215 million in this quarter alone. Reports show this number exceeded 2020, which subsequently exceeded 2019. Shocked? Not at all.

### The ugly truth behind day traders promising you a cut in the pie. No genuine proof. 

Deja vu among the streets of retail. Transparency is not ticket stubs. Verifying claims is not showing partial truths. Look at how they dance to prove themselves but never upload a public book to show their lack of competence or that they were lucky. Years of trading and no books, no records, no logs. Just MT4 logs. Sensationalist claims. Third-party verification and transparency are not defined as show-me balances. They will dance like monkeys. They will show you anything but what they don't have. Real verified track records and real proof that their absurd claims are true. To make it abundantly clear beating the market consistently makes you top 5%, maybe 1 %. There are no top traders who don't have books, logs, and whatnot to satisfy questions. Few will beat the market forever and that's fine too. Real professionals know how money works. People who know where they are don't mind showing transparency as we know overall, a blown-up account is normal. A man who shows something but also hides something else is scared. In any industry, there are always shiny guys who don't have any talent but do have a new rental. That estate agent who rips everyone off etc. The truth eventually comes out in the long term. The real trader is untouchable here and the replicas will continue to try and do what we can. Always be wary of the law of diminishing returns. She will hunt you down alpha decay style. 


### Common strategies which can lead to money loss 

The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas but in escaping from old ones. “Technical analysis” has become a remedy for bankruptcy, with no intentions of stopping.
There are various trading strategies. Mainly Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Support and Resistance (R&S) are supposedly strategies for consistent profitability and high win rates when in fact 90% of people following such techniques lose all their money. It’s gambling. Other strategies such as moving average (MA) crossovers, where you buy or sell based on the crossing of different MA lines, or Bollinger bands, selling at the top band and closing at the middle or bottom and vice versa, and various other indicators that lack consistent profitability. This all works and doesn’t work. It's what works for us we focus on, trial, improve and prosper. Rusty spoons create razor-sharp edges, think harder. Investment signals from candlestick charts are as good as an investment signal because you’re a Gemini and your assistant is a Taurus. You’re competing against massive companies with decades of experience, 100s of Ivy league/Oxbridge PhDs, supercomputers, and who are watching the markets 24/7. As an individual, it's classed by many people as gambling unless you’re in a very small market with incredible models. The aim is to join them not fight against them David vs Goliath style. It’s found thousands of trading courses are proven nonprofitable, when everyone uses the same idea, there is no edge in the market. Yet people still fall for the “$100 trading course”, it takes time to learn from these mistakes and fintech is only increasing it. 

As a closing remark, the best advice is to not only do your own research and invest with a technique you understand and feel comfortable with, but also, to only invest what you are willing to lose.
