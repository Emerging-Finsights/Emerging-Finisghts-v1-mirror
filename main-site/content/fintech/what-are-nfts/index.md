Unless you have been living under a metaphorical internet rock, chances are you have heard of NFT’s by now. If you haven’t, let me clue you in. What does the man on the street, business bros in Canary Wharf and A list celebrities such as Logan Paul and Snoop Dog have in common? Well, they’re all trying to make money though NFT’s! But what are they? How to they work? And most importantly of all, why should you care?

## What are NFT’s?

Well, lets start with the what, NFT stands for non-fungible token, non-fungible, to you and me, just means unique, one of a kind, unique en son genre. Think of it this way. One bitcoin can be seamlessly interchanged with another, they are identical, have the same value, and the same uses. The painting of your dog your dad commissioned for your mums birthday? Not so much, it will be in some way unique, there is no other painting which is quite the same in the world. Similar? Sure. The same? No. 

## How are they different to any previous digital assets?


Basic economics tells us that scarcity adds value, that’s why gold is more expensive than iron for example, and that is what gives NFT’s their value too. Through the use of blockchain, more specifically the Ethereum blockchain, NFT’s are tokenized. This means a digital certificate of ownership is created which can be bought and sold, and the blockchain technology means that the original NFT cannot be duplicated in any way. Sure, you can copy it, you can easily screenshot a piece of digital art, but this is like a scanned copy of an autograph, whereas the NFT is the ‘original’.

This has created a huge demand for NFT’s, and with high demand and low supply, prices have skyrocketed. Beeple, a popular artist who is known for creating humorous digital artwork  based on notable world events has recently sold an NFT via auction at Christie’s for $69 million, yup, so there’s that… In fact, the market for NFT’s is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. This shift is already happening, and even over the last two years the NFT market has hit huge new highs. In the second quarter of 2021, NFT’s made over $2.5 billion in sales, which is almost 20 times more than the $13.7 million in the first half of 2020. This will only rise further, with interest from major players in the financial services industry, such as payments giant Visa, who have just spent $150,000 on a NFT to be their new mascot, boosting credibility. This is in addition to a growing marketplace for transactions, means that sales are set to explode in 2022 and beyond.

## So, how big will it get?

Well, that’s the million-dollar question. It’s important to keep in mind that blockchain technology, and specifically tokenization, has the potential for implementation in many aspects of our daily lives. This, as we know, includes financial services and collectables, but could end up stretching to digital real estate, digital toys, digital trading cards, in fact thousands of assets may be digitized in the coming decade. 

We have already seen how technological developments can challenge the status quo. As soon as digital shopping became advanced enough to challenge physical shopping, everyone started shopping online, and now, the e-commerce industry is on the cusp of becoming bigger than the physical retail market. As soon as digital entertainment became advanced enough to challenge physical entertainment, everyone started streaming Netflix, and now, the digital entertainment industry is on the cusp of being bigger than the physical entertainment market. 

The president has been set, and there is no reason to believe that the market for digital assets won’t exceed even the market for physical assets. In 2020, NFT’s did $338 million in sales, already in 2021, this has reached billions. The market for physical collectables is worth about $370 billion per annum, meaning that the NFT market has room to grow by a factor of three or even four figures, suggesting this could be one of the greatest changes to the status quo since the creation of the internet. In my view, in the next decade will see NFT’s become the norm when holding any assets, revolutionizing the way we exchange goods and services forever, rendering physical stores of value obsolete and ushering us into the next stage of our digitally focused society.
