## How blockchain technology is changing finance for the better

First introduced in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W.Scott Stornetta, blockchain was developed with the aim of creating a system where timestamps could not be altered or tampered with.

We have come a long way since then, but first we jump the gun, you might be wondering what blockchains actually are? Essentially, a blockchain is a digital ledger of cryptocurrency transactions, which is recorded over a network of computers. These records are referred to as blocks. This differs from a traditional database in the way that certain blockchain 'blocks' have limited amounts of storage, and once filled, the data is then transferred into the next block which also links to the previous block, forming the 'chain'. This data is assembled in a decentralized manner, therefore no one has sole access to the data, improving security drastically.


### Decentralisation of blockchain and how it is used in crypto

Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, the data from a cryptocurrency transaction is irreversible and cannot be altered or modified. As the data is stored amongst numerous computers and locations, an attempt at altering the data would be unsuccessful as the other computers would still hold a record of the transactions, and by cross-referencing each other, the altered data would easily be pinpointed. By spreading out the data over a network of computers, the validity and transparency of the transaction history are greatly improved.

Furthermore, this prevents other variables such as electricity and power cuts from disrupting the data. Let me explain. Say there is a bitcoin farm with 1000 computers all used to store transaction data. All these computers are in the same place, using the same power supply, whilst the owner of this farm has sole control over them. If there was a power cut or an interruption with the internet connection, the stored data could potentially be lost. This is where the decentralisation of blockchain is key. The data is safe and secure as it is stored across a network of other computers and nodes, ensuring the protection of data. As no single computer has control of the network, to validate a new data entry, multiple computers must 'agree' to it before the transaction can be processed and stored.

The decentralisation of bitcoin allows anyone to view transactions, by either having a personal node or computer or by using blockchain explorers, which in essence is a search engine that allows you to view data information in a blockchain. Each node has a copy of transaction history allowing bitcoin data and transaction history to be viewed wherever, whenever. In the past, bitcoins stored on exchanges have been hacked and stolen, with the owners losing everything. Although the hackers may remain anonymous, this decentralised technology means that the bitcoins can be easily tracked down, and if the bitcoins are spent or moved, they are easily traceable.


### Efficient transactions 

Usually, transactions through banks can take several working days to be processed and banks are normally only open from 9-5, a nuisance when transactions need to be processed as a matter of urgency. Blockchain on the other hand is open and accessible 24/7, and transactions can be complete in a matter of minutes. Transaction through a bank can be time-consuming and may also require third party verification; Blockchain does not require this, which eliminates any extra costs and fees involved with traditional bank transactions.

With more and more cryptocurrencies adopting blockchain technology, I believe the future is bright for blockchain. Recognised by investors and financial institutes all over the world after 27 years, blockchain will continue to improve speed, security, and efficiency in cryptocurrency transactions.
