## Rise of Cryptocurrencies in developing Nations

Bitcoins, blockchain, crypto- once what seemed like tough nuts to crack have now come to the forefront in conversation and use. Whether you understand them or not, you are talking about how that tweet by Elon Musk “shot up the crypto market” and might even want some Bitcoin of your own. 

The global attention to this financial technology comes due to its constant evolution. Evolution in its technology, evolution in its use and evolution in its acceptance. I am sure you would agree with me that this “new” form of digital currency has seen rapid growth. 

### When did Bitcoin Actually Blow Up? 

Bitcoin technology and the currency itself however are not all that new. Bitcoin and its mining (creation of new bitcoins) were first brought to the public eye by a mysterious identity known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. 

During that same year, Bitcoin was only mined and since it was not regulated by any authority, it wasn’t possible to understand its monetary value. However, in 2010 someone chose to sell their bitcoins. They sold 10,000 of their bitcoins in exchange for 2 pizzas and this transaction valued bitcoins for the very first time. If you check the value of Bitcoins today, those pizzas essentially cost them $621 million. The currency still suffered initially as criminals were attracted to its anonymity and lack of control and it wasn’t widely accepted. 

With time, however, more digital currencies emerged using similar technology (Ethereum, Ripple, etc.), and there was a rise in the acceptance of these currencies (primarily Bitcoin) by several places. By 2017, Bitcoin had touched $10,000 and this is when everyone, literally everyone was talking about it. 

It took about 7 years for digital currencies to catch up with people. But ever since the blow up, the growth has reached exponential heights with people finding it difficult to catch up with digital currencies. 

The growth in price of Bitcoin has been approximately [352% from 2017 till 2021](https://www.statista.com/statistics/326707/bitcoin-price-index/) making it one of the fastest growing currencies in the world. It is important to note that while Bitcoin did tremendously well, it is one of the 1000s of digital currencies in the market. “Altcoins” (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin such as Ethereum) have seen high levels of growth in recent years as well. 

### Does Everyone Love the Digital Growth? 

There are two points of views to look at. From the “investment” point of view, there are the skeptics and the optimists. Some believe that digital currencies are a baseless investment as there is no regulatory body governing the actions of those managing the technology. A post on Reddit by Elon Musk moving this market by several points definitely helps their argument. However, some believe that its growing use by multinational companies and even some countries, as well as the practicality behind blockchain technology, make it a smart investment in the future. While the concern is rational, I personally believe that the technology defines the future and with time it is bound to become more efficient. I find it similar to the evolution of the internet as the world was similarly skeptical in 2000 about the web but today tech stocks are booming, and its use is increasing every day. 

From the “use” point of view, the number of multinationals willing to accept digital currencies as payment mechanisms is slowly rising. The understanding of an inevitable “digital future” is the driving force for corporates to think this way as no one wants to be left behind. While certain countries also thought along the same line, recently some countries have actively taken a step forward to the digital world. 

### Is it always going to be for the people by the people?

In September 2021, a small country in the pacific made history by being the first country in the world to accept Bitcoin as legal tender. El Salvador made the first public move towards acceptance of digital currencies by making the acceptance of Bitcoin by all vendors mandatory. 

The use of the currency in El Salvador is made possible by the use of a digital wallet called “Chivo”, which can make payments in Bitcoin denominations or their equivalent dollar amounts. As a start, the country has installed 200 Chivo ATMs to deposit cash into their wallets. 

However, the people of El Salvador did not accept this news well. They are worried that the currency might bring instability and inflation into the country which is already suffering economically. They believe the announcement had a political motive and is not thought by keeping the countries best interests in mind. 

Perhaps what El Salvador did wrong was “force” bitcoin on its citizens as Bhutan, the landlocked Kingdom nestled in the Himalayas has tried their hand at the technology and seem to be in the affirmative with their people about this. 

Bhutan is not a stranger to switching up their ways of working. Especially economically. They were the first in the world to try measuring their GDP by happiness. They are now at the top for inducing the use of digital currency tech in their financial system. They seem to always be up for change, but this wasn’t always the case. The country actively used the barter system up until the 1950s for trade and only introduced their central bank in 1968. This leisurely past, however, is no match for their current flow of thoughts. 

The Kingdom has collaborated with USA based Ripple to create a digital version of their currency- Ngultrum. The technology is sustainable as it claims to be carbon neutral and will use a private ledger that should be able to handle tens of thousands of transactions per second. With Bhutan’s project still under process, do you think this shift by smaller nations will inspire more to do the same? Will it provide them the financial growth? What about the larger nations? 

China, one of the largest in the world, has publicly shown its disagreement to the currency and the technology as a whole stating that crypto transactions are illegal. While the world took a hit, the USA might be looking at this as an opportunity to take a stake in the space. 

Vladimir Putin has also recently commented on the advantages of cryptocurrencies and has mentioned a potential digital currency in the past as well. The world is in a divide with this “new” but old technology however I personally believe that the step taken by smaller nations will help them grow at a tremendous rate by inviting foreign investments and becoming a part of the global conversation.
