## How automation and computed algorithms are transforming trading as we know it.

Developing at rapid rates, financial technology is quickly transforming the stock market as we know it. One of these revolutionary technologies is trading algorithms, which allow traders to substantially eliminate risk and human error when locking in trades. Trading algorithms, also known as black-box trading, use pre-programmed instructions and criteria, which account for multiple variables including, time, price, volume and risk. High-frequency trading combined with the speed of computers can allow tens of thousands of trades to be completed in a split second. Put simply, a trading algorithm is a trading robot that identifies buy and sell opportunities in the market and executes them based on the set criteria.


### Trading algorithms in practice 

Here is a basic example of how an algorithm executes a buy and sell order based on the set criteria by the trader.

1.	Buy 1000 shares of stock (x), when its 50-day moving average[[1]](#references) goes above the 200-day moving average.
2.	Sell 500 shares of the stock (x), when its 50 day moving average dips below the 200-day moving average 

Using these pre-programmed instructions, the algorithm will essentially constantly monitor the stock price and any fluctuations, and execute order requests when the set criteria are met, without the trader having to monitor the market or execute orders themselves.


### The benefits of utilizing algorithmic trading 

Anyone who has tried their hand at day trading to make some quick cash understands how hard it is to control their emotions. Greed and panic lead to rash decisions when trading, and these always end up as red trades at the end of the day. Algorithms reduce the mistakes made by human traders by eliminating the emotional and psychological factors involved with trading. The algorithm will time trades correctly and instantly to avoid sudden price fluctuations, without hesitation which often happens with human traders. Not to mention that an algorithm can do all this, across several markets, at the same time…

To illustrate just how successful this has become, a recent 2021 study found that the majority of Hedge Funds rely on ‘algo’ trading for their portfolios. This is further shown by the famous money manager Jim Simons, founder of Renaissance Technologies, whose flagship medallion fund returned 76% in 2020, a direct benefit of the quantitative strategy used there. 


### Trading algorithm strategies 

A couple of the most common algorithms 

#### Trend- following strategies 
-----
These are the most common and widely used strategies in trading. This strategy follows trends such as moving averages, price changes, and other relevant stock indicators. As this strategy does not require any forecasting or prediction, it is one of the easiest strategies to implement in algorithmic trading.

#### Arbitrage
-----
By using an algorithm, a dual-listed stock can be purchased in one market at a lower price and then sold for a higher price in another market. In this instance, a trading algorithm would be much more efficient in executing orders and identifying more profitable opportunities, at a much quicker speed than a human could. 


It is clear that technology and automation are driving the world forward in every aspect, especially in the stock market. Developing countries such as India, where approximately 50% of all trades are executed using algorithms, are experiencing fantastic growth, whilst at the same time, developed countries such as the US continue to steadily grow, with approximately 80% of trading volume coming from algorithmic trading. I think we will see these numbers rise, as more and more individuals and firms move to algorithms due to the accessibility and variety of algorithms on offer. The advantages of speed and accuracy combined with decreased risk are irresistible to even the most experienced of traders. The big question that remains is, with the rise of algorithms and AI, will the markets converge to the ‘strong-form’ of the efficient market hypothesis, making it impossible to beat the market?
