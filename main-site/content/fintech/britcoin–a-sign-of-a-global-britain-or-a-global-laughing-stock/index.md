The Bank of England has teamed up with the Treasury to develop their new exciting digital
asset…Britcoin. No, not Bitcoin, Britcoin. So, I hear you ask, what’s a Britcoin? Why are they making
it? And how does it differ from other cryptocurrencies?

Well, first things first, Britcoin will be a cryptocurrency. Well, kind of. Strictly speaking, Britcoin will
be a central bank digital currency (CBDC) as opposed to a typical cryptocurrency or crypto asset. The
main difference is unlike, say, Bitcoin, Britcoin will not be decentralized and will be issued and
controlled by the central bank. Because of this Britcoin will not be subjected to market forces and
will have a fixed exchange rate of £1/£1. £10 of Britcoin will always equate to the same value as a £10 note for example.

So, why are they creating a Britcoin?

Isn’t the entire USP of a cryptocurrency that it can’t be meddled with, distanced from self-interested
governments who manipulate exchange rates for their own ends? I hear you, but that’s only half the
story. Yes, Britcoin will be missing some of the key aspects of a private cryptocurrency, but it will
retain some of their uses with less risk to its holders. For example, whilst it wouldn’t be separate
from the central bank, it would be from commercial banks. Currently, we only spend the Bank of
England’s money when we spend banknotes. Any money you spend on your debit card is ‘created’
by commercial banks. Banks take a fee for this service by lending money to one another overnight,
called the overnight rate, and through charging interest on debt. As Britcoin will be separate from these commercial banks, users of this currency will cut out the middleman, and these savings may be
passed on to savers through a higher fixed rate of interest for holders of Britcoin, for example.

It also has the potential to boost investments into the UK’s financial centre at a time where London’s
dominance as a global financial hub is being challenged by other European cities such as Amsterdam
and Frankfurt. Britcoin could facilitate investments from certain high wealth countries and financial
centres from places such as the Middle East and Asia by creating a low regulation cross border
payment channel which could increase trade flows through the city of London.

It is still unclear if or when Britcoin will be launched, and how big a part it might play in the
modernisation of the British financial system. It’s clear Britcoin would be complimentary to the
current fiat system currently in place and its existence may well depend on the future regulation in
service trade with the EU. What is for certain is that this is an exciting project set out by the Bank of
England and has the potential to modernise a floundering analogue system which seems more like a
relic of a time gone by.
