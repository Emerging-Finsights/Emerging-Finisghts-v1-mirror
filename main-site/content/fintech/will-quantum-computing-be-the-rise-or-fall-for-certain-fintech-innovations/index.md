Quantum computing is the study of how to use phenomena in quantum physics to create new ways of computing. Quantum computing is made up of qubits. Unlike a normal computer bit, which can be 0 or 1 (binary), a qubit can be either of those, or a superposition of both 0 and 1. This can be extremely advantageous for certain tasks where they could vastly outperform even our best supercomputers. Therefore, quantum computing holds promise for certain FinTech use cases such as credit scoring, portfolio management, fraud management, derivative pricing, currency arbitrage and enhancing AI / ML models. It’s said that the next 3-5 years will have a financial impact of $2-5 billion, 10+ years away $25-50 billion and 20+ years away $450-850 billion when the adoption of quantum computing will be in full scale. 

In the current state the technology is still costly, however, it has demonstrated exponential improvements over existing technology in terms of security, speed and accuracy. Also, as the technology matures along with usage, it should become more feasible. Institutional demand for quantum technology and exposure is also booming; Google appear to be leading the movement with recent reports suggesting its quantum computer was able to perform a calculation in 200 seconds, whereas traditional supercomputer would take 10,000 years or more. When looking at FinTech and the integration with quantum technology, the possibilities can be revolutionary, however, its power can be abused, pointing to the ethical problems this may cause when in the wrong hands.

## The rise? Fraud detection, mortgages, risk management and the stock market

The loan market has been subject to scrutiny ever since the subprime mortgage crash, also known as the Global Finance Crash. Artificial intelligence (AI) in conjunction with quantum computing could enable loan applications to be transacted quickly, while the inclusion of pre-programmed rules could enable automated approval of mortgages and different loan facilities; a very welcomed improvement. Customised products could also be recommended, minimising customer dissatisfaction. Standard Chartered Bank, for example, is exploring several use cases (such as risk management) while understanding the importance of developing new financial products with assistance from this technology.

In banking, seeing potential in fraud detection, pricing of complex structured products, high-frequency trading, and risk management. For these areas, large amounts of data need to be linked and processed, because the more data that flows into AI / quantum algorithms, the more accurate fraud detection analyses and risk simulations will become.

Traditional risk models use Monte Carlo simulations to forecast the impact of macroeconomic events, transparency requirements and other regulatory frameworks. Increasingly complex models with many simulation parameters mean that the number of scenarios to be analysed grow exponentially. With increasing complexity, calculation times can take several days, calling into question the economic benefit. In a recent pilot project, Deutsche Börse managed to reduce a 10 year calculation of complete sensitivity analysis with 1000 input parameters to less than 30 minutes of computing time using quantum algorithms.

Unprecedented competitive advantages and market differentiation could also arise in high-speed trading. In the form of stock market trading, algorithms anticipate market changes, calculate price advantages, and make trading decisions independently on this basis. Today, processing market data in real time and sending orders to the stock exchange via optimized data lines takes little more than a second. Theoretically, the quantum computer can handle the calculations within a few nanoseconds. Although there are only tiny profits per transaction here, large volumes could dominate stock market activity. Nonetheless, a repeat of the 2010 Flash Crash could also increase in probability. 


## The fall? Blockchain vulnerabilities and how start-ups are forming solutions. 

Right now, quantum thieves can't do anything with the blockchain blocks they have access to. The sophisticated mathematical encryptions used to secure the blocks are indecipherable by traditional computers, and the security employed to safeguard each of these blocks is resilient and resistant to standard cracking methods in its current form.

Quantum computers executing quantum algorithms, on the other hand, may be able to do so in the not-too-distant future, and will almost certainly be able to do so with reasonable ease. There might be massive leaks of blockchain data if quantum computing becomes affordable, leading to crypto projects being hacked. A post-quantum criminal might send a forged block or create a ‘fork' in the chain, causing the chain to split in two meaning that every point forward would be based on a modified version of history. This could result in multiple versions of ‘histories’ that make it impossible to determine who owns valuable assets and see criminals steal what isn’t theirs. This makes blockchains a natural and potentially profitable target for hackers. As quantum computing skills improve and become more available to a wider audience, the danger of hackers attacking the blockchain grows. It will only be a matter of time before strong quantum computers, which are presently being developed, can crack larger and larger keys; my belief is this could happen in as little as 5 years.

Cryptography and keys are used in every hazard area identified in blockchains, including communication between network nodes and the integrity of digitally signed transactions. Quantum computers are vulnerable to assaults on these keys. To secure these regions, the creation of these keys must be enhanced and advanced to maintain the security and integrity of whole blockchain networks, something that UK company Cambridge Quantum just accomplished. The Cambridge-based business has created a proof-of-concept that may be implemented as a post-quantum cryptography in conjunction with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and Tecnológico de Monterrey.

The design of this layered solution is that it not only allows the internet's or blockchain protocols' algorithms to remain unchanged – they don't need to be changed to be protected – but it also allows the layer to be applied on top of all existing blockchain technologies to provide quantum security.

With our financial system edging closer to a decentralised ecosystem (DeFi) and blockchain being more and more adopted, the circumstances of quantum hackers could cause havoc globally. What will the future hold? Will cryptocurrencies survive under the quantum computing progression?
