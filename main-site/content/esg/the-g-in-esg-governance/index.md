## This article is the last in a three-part mini-series and will provide an overview of the ‘G’ in ESG, which stands for ‘Governance’. 

‘Governance’ is a term that doesn’t allude to all that much but can evoke fear in those tasked with implementing it successfully. Although governance structures vary from business to business, they essentially include any and all of those with a vested interest; directors, managers, shareholders and stakeholders. This less popularised component of the new conscious investing era underpins businesses’ ability to deliver on a whole range of ESG targets.

The focus of these governance structures is multifaceted and includes, but is not limited to, the following: gender diversity and equity, transparency and reporting, executive remuneration and compliance. As companies are increasingly held accountable, major failures in these areas often make the headlines. This has especially been the case during the pandemic years where the upheaval of the working world revealed home truths that companies were forced to confront.

S&P Global assesses companies’ performance on four factors of governance: structure and oversight, code and values, transparency and reporting, and cyber risk and systems. There is a correlation between companies that rank highly in ‘Governance’ also performing highly in the categories of ‘Environment’ and ‘Social’. From a financial point of view, companies with stronger governance credentials can also enjoy a positive reputation amongst investors and consumers. Historical governance scandals, including Facebook’s Data Misuse and Volkswagen’s Emission Tests, have cost oblivious investors billions, so the push for transparency is welcomed in most cases.

While companies with failing governance systems and structures are shunned, those at the other end of the spectrum should be championed. Chipotle is a major brand celebrated for including ESG metrics in its executive compensation plans. They dedicate 10% of officers’ annual incentive bonus budgets to ESG targets, as well as ensuring quarterly progress updates. As of August 2021, the Nasdaq exchange requires companies to disclose board diversity information. This is visionary for a ticker such as Nasdaq that hosts 3500 companies with the majority based in tech, an industry with historically low levels of women representation.

With the revelation of some clearly unsustainable governance structures, what does the road ahead look like for rules, roles, and regulation? As the WFH and ‘hybrid-working’ narrative continues, we could see companies plunged into a new era of governance entirely. It will be interesting to monitor how the evolution of attitudes towards corporate governance alters the checklist companies need to perform against to be considered effective or successful.

Hopefully, this mini-series has provided some clarity, dispelled some myths, and emphasised the importance of ESG for companies and investors alike. As companies have been forced to transform in the wake of COVID-19, it provides them with the opportunity to embed ESG in their new strategy. The rate at which ESG investing is gaining traction, on the investment floor and in the media, demands attention. The proliferation is promising, but it is now essential for companies to turn words into actions and put their money where their values are.
