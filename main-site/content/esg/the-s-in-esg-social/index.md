In the second part of an introductory series on the fundamentals of ESG investing, this article provides a brief overview of the social element, the ‘S’.

The social aspect of sustainable investing, S, addresses the relationships a company has and the reputation it manages with its workforce, the societies in which it operates, and the political environment with people and institutions in the communities where it does business. Social factors are wide-ranging and can include a variety of aspects such as supply chain considerations (like working conditions of suppliers), company selling practices (like consumer protection, customer privacy and data security) and a company’s impact on its community (like the impact on local businesses and use of local workforces). 

Every company operates within a broader, diverse society. The social criteria that one company may use to evaluate its corporate social responsibility may differ from that of another. For instance, Germans generally tend to place greater emphasis on respecting human rights and avoiding child labour. In the UK, by contrast, the issue of workplace diversity has become increasingly important in recent years.

The societal element has lagged behind the environmental and governmental factors; reporting social impact has traditionally been disjointed and incomparable. This is beginning to change, though. The unequal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Black Lives Matter protests, and the #MeToo movement have been instrumental drivers in increasing the recognition of the need for social change and the important contribution that businesses must make. Social issues are now among the most pressing for companies in all markets as stakeholders, both internal and external, seek to understand how the firm they work for, buy from or invest in is treating the people whose lives its operations touch. 

Despite this, however, there remains several key challenges for social aspects to overcome in the future. There currently exists no standardised framework agreed by and available to companies. Without common frameworks, it is difficult for analysts to compare the performance of two companies, for regulators to develop standards, and for shareholders and other stakeholders to hold companies to account. The lack of comparability of businesses because of the volume and inconsistency of frameworks prevents efficient market behaviour. This predicament is partially explained by there being no consistent global consensus on what social outcomes should be prioritised whilst taking into account issues affecting individual countries and how shared social objectives like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) should be achieved whilst respecting cultural preferences or norms. Data involving social issues are frequently in the form of qualitative-based research, and therefore it is significantly more difficult for ESG rating agencies to provide reliable ESG ratings for investors. As such, investors may feel less able to rely on ESG ratings for social issues and compelled to continue to perform their own assessments to satisfy their due diligence requirements. 

Furthermore, there is some misguided confusion between investors about the existence of a trade-off: increased social impact at the expense of profitability. Whilst strong social standards act as a risk mitigation mechanism and, to some investors, could be a signal for decreased economic returns, any belief that delivering social impact is at odds with economic returns presents a significant challenge. It could prevent capital flowing towards ESG focused markets, slowing momentum towards achieving a coherent set of social principles and standards.

The solution to these obstacles is clear: there needs to be a global approach. Global consistency and clarity in how social policy outcomes are integrated into sustainable finance would ensure better overall outcomes and enable the comparability that is essential for accountability. With consensus on the principles and the metrics, we would hope to see policymakers move towards the adoption of common standards. To quote KPMG’s Report on Accelerating the S in ESG, “The lack of comparability of businesses as a result of the volume and inconsistency of frameworks hinders efficient market behaviour, and for this reason alone, one coherent set of principles, metrics and standards would be beneficial.” Let’s hope this can be established sooner rather than later.
