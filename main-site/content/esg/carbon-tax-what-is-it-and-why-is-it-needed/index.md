## What it is, and why it's needed

The data is quite clear on what needs to be done to mitigate the worst aspects of climate change: we must transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy. However, this will forever remain elusive as long as the production and usage of fossil fuels remains to be the cheapest option for global industry. One way to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels would be the implementation of a carbon tax. 

## What exactly is a carbon tax? 

A carbon tax can come in many forms, however at its core, there are two main configurations: An emissions tax where the government sets a price that emitters must pay for each ton of greenhouse gas emissions that they produce; and a tax on goods and services which are known to be greenhouse gas intensive, such as a tax on gasoline or kerosene. The argument is that this would incentivise the heaviest polluters to take the necessary steps to adopt newer and more renewable forms of energy production, in order to avoid paying large amounts of money on the carbon tax. 
Taxes on greenhouse gases come in two broad forms: an emissions tax, which is based on the quantity an entity produces; and a tax on goods or services that are generally greenhouse gas-intensive, such as a carbon tax on gasoline. However, one must also be realistic and fair about such tax implementation. It is important to be aware of the fact that as it currently stands, the vast majority of people rely upon fossil fuels in their day to day life, to drive their car to work , or to heat their home. In addition, lower income individuals spend a much higher proportion of their wages on fuel, and so rising fuel prices affect these people more acutely. It is grossly unfair that these people would be punished for the fact that they are simply choosing the most affordable option to do these everyday tasks. This is why a *dividend* program is often proposed alongside a carbon tax. In this programme, individuals would receive a yearly or monthly cheque to offset the increased cost in living from a carbon tax (in fact, studies have shown that the majority of people would receive more in dividends then they would pay in increased prices). These individuals would be free to spend this money on what they wish. If the government also had programmes in which home solar, heat pumps, and/or EV’s are subsidised, then individuals would then be incentivized to use these dividend payments on making their day to day life more sustainable, and would then be able to evade paying for a carbon tax completely. 

Ultimately, there is a need for a carbon tax because there is a great deal of evidence to show that carbon taxes are effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. More than 40 governments across the world have already adopted a carbon tax of some kind. For example, in the UK carbon emissions have fallen to their lowest level since 1890 thanks to a carbon price of £18 per ton of CO2, and Sweden’s carbon tax has helped reduce emissions by 26% since 1990. 

Look, no one *likes* taxes. No one likes tax increases. But it is often said that 
>taxes are the price we pay for a civilised society. 

Perhaps we should view a carbon tax as the price to pay for a sustainable one.
