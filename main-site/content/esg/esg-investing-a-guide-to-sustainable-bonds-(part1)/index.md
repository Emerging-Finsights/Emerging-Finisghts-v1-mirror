Bond structures and the investment landscape can be a complex and confusing space, especially with the rise of ESG-linked bonds. However, they don’t have to be. This article will break down the different types of sustainable bonds and hopefully make sustainable investing just that little bit easier to understand.

First off, what exactly is a bond? A bond is a means for governments and companies to raise debt from investors in order to finance specific projects or for general business purposes. Investors receive interest in the form of a coupon as their investment return.

Essentially, environmental, social and governance (ESG)-linked bonds are issued to help make the world more sustainable and overcome many of the challenges we face today. The first sustainable bond was issued in 2007 by the European Investment Bank. Since then, the market has seen an exponential increase, especially in recent years, in the issuance of these types of bonds, and it’s only expected to continue to grow. 

The International Capital Market Association (ICMA) has set out the framework and principles of sustainable bonds. This was first published in 2014 but is updated regularly to keep up with the dynamic world of sustainable finance. The ICMA has broken sustainable bonds down into four main types; green, social, sustainability and sustainability linked. 

## Green bonds

Green bonds are used to finance projects that are environmentally beneficial. This can include projects aimed at renewable energy, climate change mitigation, sustainable agriculture, wastewater management and sustainable infrastructure. A subset of green bonds is blue bonds which are specifically used to finance ocean conservation-related projects. However, these remain the most niche ESG bond, with only four blue bonds issued globally.

From almost nothing a decade ago, green bond sales have exploded since the first one was issued in 2007. According to NN Investment Partners, the global green bond market is set to reach €2 trillion by the end of 2023.[[1]](#references) The US is leading the way in this growth, having issued 17% of the global share in the first half of 2021.[[2]](#references) It will be interesting to see how China’s pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 will impact the rate of green bond issuance in Asia. What has become clear, however, is that green bonds are absolutely vital in helping to reach the climate objectives set out in the Paris Agreement.


## Social bonds

Social bonds were first introduced in 2010 with the sole purpose of raising money for social challenges within different societies, populations, and groups. These bonds could finance projects such as providing affordable housing or basic infrastructure (sanitation, access to services, clean drinking water) or managing food security. 

Social bond issuance by governments saw a surge in 2020 as countries tried to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, and they are only expected to continue to rise amongst the post-pandemic recovery. It is expected that social bond issuance will soon overtake green bonds as a result of the pandemic. French lender, BNP Paribas, is leading the race within the banking markets and have issued $7.32 billion worth of social bonds in the first quarter of 2021.[[3]](#references)

## Sustainability bonds

Sustainability bonds address both environmental and social projects which do not fit under the specific categories set out by the ICMA. This is because certain projects might have both social and green benefits. For example, developing greener cities will have positive climate benefits and positively impact human health. Many of these bonds revolve mostly around the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

US lenders Citi, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs have taken the top three spots in sustainability bond issuance, all issuing over $3.5 billion in the first quarter of 2021.[[4]](#references) The largest sustainability bond deal so far happened last year when Alphabet, Google’s parent company, issued a deal with $5.75 billion.[[5]](#references)

## Sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs)

These are bonds that are used to cover general financing needs but are linked to predefined ESG related goals. SLBs generally don’t cover specific projects and don’t specify how an issuer should spend the money; however, it relies on the company’s sustainability performance. If a company improves on their sustainability performance metrics, they are rewarded, but if they miss those targets, they are punished through a coupon step-up.

This article was only a brief introduction to sustainable bonds. Keep an eye out for the next part of the article! It will delve deeper into how these bonds are issued and how they are managed. It will also look at the problems surrounding this developing market, including issues such as the different risks associated with each bond and “greenwashing”, where companies can issue or receive sustainable bonds, despite being seen as bad for the environment.
