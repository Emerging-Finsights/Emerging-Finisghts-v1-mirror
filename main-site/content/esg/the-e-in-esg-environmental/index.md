In the first part of an introductory series on the fundamentals of ESG investing, where we seek to outline and define what E, S, and G actually mean, this article will address what is often regarded (either rightly or wrongly) as the most important of the three; E.

The ‘E’ in ESG investing stands for environmental (or, more completely, environmental risk). When investors look at the relationship between a firm and the environment, they are generally interested in how a firm conducts its business, both in the day to day operations of the company and across its supply chain. There is no definitive method of doing this. However, often the criteria are split into four different camps:

-	contribution to climate change (such as carbon footprint)
-	use of natural resources (such as water)
-	practices of waste disposal (such as toxic waste)
-	positive environmental contribution (such as clean energy financing) 

In the past, investment managers focused on not including specific investments in their portfolios that they believed negatively contributed to the environment, a process known as exclusion. For instance, a fund could exclude a weapons manufacturer from its portfolio as that firm would be classified as having an overall detrimental impact on the environment. However, today’s investment managers take a more holistic approach to exclusion and a more positive approach to financing firms that are more beneficial for the environment. An example of this would be excluding not only the weapons manufacturer but also the companies within its supply chain and/or financing a wind turbine and solar panel manufacturer.

As mentioned before, the environmental component of ESG is often regarded as the most pertinent, but why is this the case? Firstly, environmental issues and risks touch nearly every industry, and generally speaking, environmental sustainability is a far more tangible issue than social or governance issues. Secondly, the relationship between sustainability and positive financial returns is far more apparent; if a business operates in a sustainable fashion with an eye to the future, it is more likely to create stable, long term value rather than volatile, short term results. In addition, certain industries are only going to grow in size, such as renewable energy component manufacturers or alternative protein companies. Thirdly, for a great many people, the climate crisis is the key issue of the day. Companies that operate negatively in this space are, therefore, more exposed to reputational risk than the companies that are more active in providing solutions to this issue.

Generally speaking, this is an issue that involves every citizen of this planet, and it’s high time we start treating it that way. Ernest Hemingway once said, “the Earth is a fine place, and it’s worth fighting for”. I can say with some certainty that the fight is on.
