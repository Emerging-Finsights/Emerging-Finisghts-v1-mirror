**The [first part of this article](/esg/esg-investing-a-guide-to-sustainable-bonds-part1/) series on sustainable bonds broke down the different types associated with the ESG investing market. This week’s article will address how sustainable bonds are issued, managed and what challenges arise from this process.**

There has been an explosion in the sustainable finance market with a strong demand from investors wishing to ‘greenify’ their portfolios. Due to the fast growth and dynamic nature of this relatively new market, several concerns have naturally developed, which could undermine the credibility and evolution of green bond issuance. One of the biggest issues currently facing the sustainable bond market is a process known as ‘greenwashing’, occurring when a company makes inflated claims about their sustainability credentials and its practices misalign with green frameworks. To understand how greenwashing occurs, we need to understand how sustainable bonds are issued.

For a sustainable bond to be issued, it needs to meet certain criteria. The first green bond issued in 2007 acted as a framework for the sustainable finance market by creating global standards for issuance and reporting. Since then, the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) established the Green Bond Principles (GBP) to develop more clearly outlined guidelines for investors. These guidelines explain that issuers must disclose the evaluation process used to select the project in question and, more importantly, how they plan to manage the bond proceeds going forward. Both the use and impact of the money raised require frequent monitoring. Furthermore, external evaluation of the bond is required to ensure all stages are adequately followed and aligned to the green framework.

Whilst these criteria have been set out by the ICMA, they are still simply guidelines. The issuance of a sustainable bond is structured around how the bond proceeds are used, and there are currently no penalties for not using the funds as specified. Since issuers can self-label their bonds as green based on guidance from regulators, stock exchanges and market associations, it is estimated that around 85% of green bonds deserve the label. There is increasing concern that the rapid expansion of the green bond market will allow companies to issue debt that is environmentally and socially responsible in name only. The other 15% of green bonds issued are given to companies or institutions that use the funds for environment-friendly projects that only represent a small part of their operations and are actually involved in broader activities that contravene environmental standards. The Australian government, for example, have been targeted for blatant greenwashing as they receive funding for projects such as preserving the Great Barrier Reef, yet they are also massive state-funders of the coal industry, which directly impacts the endangered ecosystem. Unfortunately, companies can issue green bonds without having any intention of addressing the parts of the business that remain in industries that negatively impact the environment. However, if companies can prove that they have a long-term transition plan towards more sustainable practices and aren’t just using green bonds for PR purposes, is this such a bad thing? 

Sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) attempt to overcome these issues. Since they are used to cover general financing needs but are linked to predefined ESG related goals, the bonds structural characteristics mean that the coupon, maturity, or repayment amount can vary depending upon whether the issuer meets the goal it set itself. Investors can reward borrowers when they improve on the pre-determined metrics or punish them with higher interest payments if they miss those targets.

Hopefully, as the market continues to develop, more regulation will ensure that sustainable bonds are appropriately used for the project initially specified. It will be interesting to see if the auditing of green bonds, which will provide more rigorous external validation, will become more commonplace in the financial services industry. For now, investors must do more extensive background research on the credentials of the issuer and the company as a whole rather than just blindly trusting the green label.
