On November 15th, 2021, President Biden signed the $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This act will provide $550 billion in new spending to build or repair existing infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, water infrastructure, broadband, and more. 

Below I will outline some of the key environmental provisions within the bill. While numerous provisions implicitly address climate change, such as the modernisation of public transit, this article will address the policies that explicitly address climate change and pollution. 

## $47 Billion for climate change adaptation infrastructure 

As the effects of anthropogenic climate change worsen, our need to adapt to these increasing challenges will need to improve. Already, many Americans are experiencing the effects of climate change, whether it be through increased wildfire risks or the flooding of American homes and schools. In this bill, approximately $47 billion has been set aside to address these issues. For example, the Army Corps of Engineers will receive a funding boost of $11.6 billion to be used for projects like flood control and river dredging. 

## $16 Billion for clean-up of historic pollution, including orphan oil and gas wells and abandoned mines 

Nearly 200 years of oil and gas development across the continental United States has left thousands of so-called "orphan" wells. These oil and gas wells are inactive, unplugged, and have no record solvent owner; therefore, no one can be deemed responsible for closing them up. Unfortunately, when left unplugged, these oil and gas wells leak toxic chemicals into the air and through groundwater, negatively impacting human health. This bill seeks to address some of these issues, with $11.3 billion pledged towards abandoned mine land and water reclamation projects and $4.7 billion dedicated to orphaned well site plugging, remediation, and restoration activities. 

## $7.5 Billion for electric vehicle charging 

Most people agree that fossil fuel-based transport is a central contributor to overall greenhouse gas emissions. One way we can transition away from fossil fuel-based transport is by encouraging the use and purchase of retail electric vehicles. However, a major complaint about electric vehicles is that there isn't sufficient infrastructure when it comes to charging these cars. No one wants to have their car run out of charge miles away from the nearest charging point. This is why $7.5 billion has been included in this bill in order to expand the network of charging points, which will have a particular focus on rural, disadvantaged and hard-to-reach communities. 

## $7.5 Billion for Clean School Buses & Ferries 

On the face of it, this seems like an odd inclusion when it comes to discussing the 'key environmental provisions' within this bill, but on further examination, it is actually quite an impactful policy measure. Scientists have known for a long time that diesel pollution can cause a host of health problems, such as asthma, bronchitis, developmental disabilities, and cancer. Therefore, the conversion of school buses, 95% of which run on diesel fuel, to low and zero-emission buses is highly welcomed. Within the act, there is $2.5 billion earmarked for zero-emission buses, $2.5 billion for low emission buses, and $2.5 billion for ferries.

While it frustrated many to see the climate provisions within this bill be watered down during negotiation, it still accomplishes a great deal. What is more is that the Build Back Better Act, which has passed the house but not the Senate as of writing, contains approximately half a trillion dollars for climate change provisions. But more on that later â€¦
