It’s fair to say that news in recent times has been relatively grim. It seems that almost daily, there is a new disaster, with the coronavirus outbreak and the worsening situation with climate change being the most recent examples. It has become clear from these events that the planet we inhabit is a force of nature we can’t control, with the ability to cause a widescale global impact. Although scientists, governments, and corporations have all been working to prevent climate change from causing irreversible damage, many feel big corporations are not doing enough. This is why ESG investing is so important. Companies have the responsibility and resources to help build a more resilient future, and by investing in more socially conscious companies, we can all help be facilitators in this change.

## What is ESG? 

ESG is an investment framework used by socially conscious investors to evaluate the sustainability of a company’s operations based on environmental, social and governance. Although the ‘E’ in ESG usually takes priority with investors, it is paramount to understand how all three factors link so that investments can be made on a more integrated approach. The reasoning for this is clear; would you invest in an environmentally friendly company where males are paid double the salary of females, and every board member is over 75 years old? Probably not.

## ESG Factors 

There are many factors investors use to screen potential investments, these can include (but are not limited to): 

### Environmental Factors:
- What are the company’s carbon emissions? Including scopes 1, 2 and 3.
- What packaging does the company use for its products?
- Does the company manage its water use responsibly?
- Does the company receive a lot of media scrutiny about its environmental practices?

### Social Factors:
- How does the company approach diversity?
- What is in place to prevent bribery and corruption? 
- How does the company treat its staff, suppliers and customer privacy?
- Is the company’s marketing strategy fair and appropriate?

### Governance Factors:
- Are managers paid appropriately and in line with shareholder interests?
- Are there many independent board members? Are the CEO and chairman separate roles?
- Does the company use fair accounting practices? Is executive pay fully disclosed?
- Do shareholders have equal voting rights?

## Summary

It is essential to approach ESG as an integrated, top-down method of assessing a company’s credentials. The key phrase to use here is sustainability. One cannot understand a company’s environmental stance without first understanding its corporate governance structure and financial health. Although ESG can be used as a final check when making investments, proper due diligence is recommended before making any serious decision.
