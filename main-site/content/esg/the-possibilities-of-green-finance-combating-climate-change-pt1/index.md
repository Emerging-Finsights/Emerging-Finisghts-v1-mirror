Green finance (or climate finance), the orderly transition to a green financial system and mobilising investment in clean and resilient growth, has received a lot of media attention recently (COP 26 springs to mind). In a utopian world, a ubiquitous global green economy would ensure current and future financial risks not only incorporate climate and environmental factors, but also integrate them into mainstream financial decision making. However, we do not live in this world. This segment of your weekly ESG-related content will be split into 2 parts; this section, part 1, will discuss why the financial system is so important in combatting climate change and how, in theory, it could go about mitigating the risks of a warming, more turbulent climate.

### Why is the financial system so important in combatting climate change?

Capital accumulation and directing it to the most efficient areas occurs every second globally. That same large-scale investment is needed to mitigate the effects of climate change. Theoretically, it can operate in a very similar framework with the same tools as the greenhouse gas (GHG)-intensive industries. Climate change is essentially one large risk separated into many smaller, more general or idiosyncratic risks. Therefore, there is a need to map and identify the possible climate change-related risks for the financial sector. That implies quantifying the impact on insurance liabilities and on the value of financial assets that may arise from losses related to climate change (flooding, storms, etc). The State of the Global Climate 2021 report highlighted that the average global sea level reached a record high this year. The concentration of major greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has also increased over the past twelve months. Floods in Europe and China drew global attention throughout the summer. Each of these disasters has significant impacts on the labour market with people unable to work, travel and pay their debts, all of which have wider disturbances to the interrelated economy.

### Green Bonds

Discussed in a previous article [article](/esg/esg-investing-a-guide-to-sustainable-bonds-part1/), the use of green bonds and aligning them with the 4 core components of the Green Bond Principles (GBP), where the proceeds will be exclusively applied to financing eligible green projects, is critical in this transformation to a more sustainable economy. Green funding is intended to accelerate research into new technologies, reducing the marginal price per unit of a product or service, therefore making it more competitive against its less altruistic counterparts. This in turn could encourage competing firms to adopt a greener strategy, potentially reverberating throughout the financial system. For proof, one needs to look no further than the report from Carbon Brief. This report claims that the UK is to get its first subsidy-free offshore windfarms after the government awarded contracts for nearly 6 gigawatts (GW) of capacity, at prices so low that the windfarms could generate electricity more cheaply than existing gas-fired power stations as early as 2023.

Finally, climate change requires international cooperation, as it is a unique global problem. One of the more successful stories to come out of COP 26 was the Breakthrough Agenda, whereby pledgers commit to ‘work together to make clean technologies and sustainable solutions the most affordable, accessible and attractive option in each emitting sector globally before 2030’ (UN Climate Change Conference, 2021). This came with the ‘Glasgow Breakthroughs’ – the first set of global goals in high emitting sectors underneath this agenda. So, progress is being made to transform the financial system into something new that can adopt core green principles to reinvigorate future financial technologies and decisions.

Despite this, there are fundamental, immovable obstacles that exist and remain pervasive in halting any real progress the financial system can make in combatting climate change. There are deeply ingrained mechanisms within the financial system that won’t enable the greening of every aspect of the economy to occur, some run deep into human nature and have been covered over 250 years ago by Adam Smith. The core problems and how they could be overcome will be discussed in part 2.
