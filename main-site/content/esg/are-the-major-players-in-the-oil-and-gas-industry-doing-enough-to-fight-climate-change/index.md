### How the likes of BP and Shell are transitioning to more sustainable practices.

As climate change concerns grow, the world's major energy companies have found themselves under harsh scrutiny. Many different groups, such as customers, corporate partners, investors, shareholders, and activists, are putting increasing pressure on oil and gas companies by challenging their climate policies and emission reduction plans. Many believe they are no way near achieving Paris climate goals. 

The oil and gas industry is one of the biggest polluters globally and has undoubtedly had a significant impact on the climate. The burning of fossil fuels releases CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, which contributes to the current trend of global warming.

One solution to combat the rising temperatures is through an increased focus on the transition to clean and renewable energy sources. It is expected that by 2050 about half of the global energy production will come from renewable sources. In order to reach this goal, it will require vast amounts of energy investment and more commitment from large multi-national corporations to achieve these targets.

### What is being done?

European energy companies, such as Shell and BP, are already ahead of their American counterparts in terms of transition strategies, with Chevron and Exxon having nascent policies concerning climate change. Shell has set out plans to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. The oil major has begun to dispose of some of its fossil fuel assets and reinvested the returns into renewables. Since 2016, it is estimated that they have spent about £1.4bn on renewable energy investments [(1)](#references). 

BP has taken a more hard-line approach. Since 2020, their CEO Bernard Looney has made a conscious effort to put BP at the forefront of industry change. They have pledged to cut their hydrocarbon business by around 40% throughout the next decade [(2)](#references). BP has previously been pioneering natural gas extraction technology, and their facility in Oman earned them more than $650 million in profits in 2019 [(3)](#references). However, earlier this year, the oil major agreed to sell a third of its majority stake in the project. The deal is part of a larger strategy to liquidate their oil and gas assets, something they have been doing for almost a decade, and instead, turn to investments for renewable-energy projects. Many have been sceptical about BP's bold decisions. They have claimed that they risk moving too fast in trading high-quality oil assets for more speculative renewable-energy investments, leaving BP with mostly lower-quality assets that will become harder to unload later as the entire industry looks to transition to cleaner energy sources. These projects won't make BP money for years, and they are massively losing out on potential profits. However, although the renewables market is slower in returns, it is much more stable than the volatile oil industry, where prices can rise or fall dramatically. Regardless of the profits, surely the focus on more sustainable energy practices is the most favourable? It will be interesting to see how this develops over the next couple of years.

### Is this going to work?

It's noteworthy as to whether the oil majors' investment in renewable energy will actually help the world shift away from a system based on fossil fuels. It really depends on who ends up buying the assets being sold off by them. Ultimately, the sale of a fossil fuel asset does not mean that the company will suddenly stop emitting GHGs; it is simply a transfer of ownership, placing the asset from one companies books to another, rather than being shut down completely. 

All oil majors face mounting pressure from regulators and investors worldwide to develop cleaner energy and divest from fossil fuels. In today's world, a company's investment portfolio has become more crucial than ever, with more and more investors looking to put money into companies with a strong ESG purpose. How well an energy company can transition to renewables is key for future performance. 

This does raise a dilemma for investment firms. Investors could essentially have a blanket policy to exclude energy companies from their investments; however, blunt approaches to complex challenges have usually proved not the best way to enact real change. A sudden shift away from oil production from the major European players could have substantial economic consequences and knock-on effects globally. Therefore, change can't happen overnight, and it will take time, careful planning, heavy investment and innovative solutions. Ultimately, you can't solve a global problem by targeting a single company; there needs to be a global shift in how all industries tackle climate change. 

The world is therefore looking to all oil and gas companies with their deep pockets, scientific expertise and extensive experience in managing big engineering projects. What they do could help determine whether the world can meet the goals of the Paris agreement to limit the increase of global temperatures, which Oil Change International has claimed that no major oil company is even close to fulfilling. If oil and gas companies continue with business as usual, there is zero chance they will be aligned to clearing the bar of 1.5°C by 2050. The baseline is: the growth of fossil fuels is simply incompatible with solving global warming.
