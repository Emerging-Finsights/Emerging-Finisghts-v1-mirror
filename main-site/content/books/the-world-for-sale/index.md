Have you ever wondered who really runs the world? Microeconomic theory discusses how best to allocate
scarce resources, however, who holds these scarce resources? The government? No. The NGOs? No. The
banks? No. The people who run the world and allocate scarce resources are actually the commodity
traders.

Commodity trading has long been seen as one of the most lucrative but secretive businesses in the world.
Javier Blas and Jack Farchy, two of the most established commodity journalists writing for Bloomberg and
previously the Financial Times, have collated and orchestrated a 2021 award-winning book on the industry.

No, this book does not uncover mainstream events around commodities, it goes a lot deeper than that.
The authors have eloquently turned hundreds of interviews with ex-senior commodity traders and 15+
years of journalism into a masterpiece on commodity trading from the start up until now. If you have ever
wondered how little known companies like Trafigura, Vitol, Glencore, Cargill, Louis Dreyfus, etc remain so
secretive while making billions under the nose of the governments, then look no further.

The stories told in this book are not reported by mainstream media, simply because the media does not
know about them. Commodity trades act with covertness in the darkest corners of the world to secure
some of the most lucrative deals of the century, generating more profit than some of the best S&P500
companies. From Jamaica to Cuba to the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of the Arab Spring, these
traders jet around the globe in search of commodities for discounted prices to lock in a sweet profit. The
best part about it? The governments canâ€™t stop them, and in fact, before the time of the technological
revolution, agencies like the CIA used to rely on these traders for sensitive information on enemies.

From the legends of commodity trading such as Marc Rich to the lesser well know moguls who have
pocketed billions over the years, this book shows who really runs the world. If you want to discover the
untold stories of commodity trading, buy this book and buy it yesterday.
