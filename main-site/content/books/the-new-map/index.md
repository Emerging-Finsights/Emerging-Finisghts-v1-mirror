Geopolitics and the central role of energy in dictating international relations are now more important than ever. Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer prize winner for The Prize, has produced another exceptionally informative book based on the rise and fall of the big energy players over the past century at a time when the world is eager to see where the future of energy will go. 

For the main part of this book, Daniel Yergin alludes to the various conflicts integrated in the dominant energy players such as the US, Russia, China and the Middle East. From the shale revolution in the US to the Belt and Road initiative in China and the annexation of Crimea by Russia, Mr Yergin does an excellent job at delving into the intricacies that dictate how the supply and demand of the energy we consume are altered. With current affairs being so dire in areas like Afghanistan, Iran, Ukraine and the South China Sea, Daniel Yergin has timed this book to perfection as a ‘go to’ tool for a brief history of different conflicts and their global implications on energy. Along with this, Daniel offers a unique insight into how Covid-19 has and will change the energy landscape post pandemic. 

Nonetheless, if you were eager to understand the renewable energy revolution away from oil and gas and into the greener, more sustainable energy sources, you might be disappointed. The last two chapters of the book offer a brief introduction into the ‘new era’ of energy sources such as wind, solar and nuclear in different regions. Nevertheless, the depth of detail surrounding these pages are elementary at best, therefore, I would not get your hopes up if this is what you are after.

Overall, whether you find yourself interested in understanding global politics or the recent changes in energy markets, this book offers exceptional insights into such landscapes and acts as a great foundation to build your knowledge on. Now more than ever, geopolitics is playing a fundamental part in investor decisions, therefore, to get ahead of the curve, I recommend this book to all international macro investors trying to make sense of the political landscape, as well as incoming graduates wanting to impress recruiters with their geopolitical knowledge.
