Who better to teach you about tech than product managers from Google, Microsoft and Facebook? This book offers an in-depth yet digestible rendition of the current cryptocurrency craze taking the world by storm.

It begins by explaining in layman’s terms, what cryptocurrencies are, how they work and some of the fundamental economics that governs their speculation. These explanations break down the complexities of blockchain and deliver them in a simplistic manner which allow you to understand the technology at the most basic level.

The book then covers the fundamental flaws with current crypto “currencies” dominating the space and convincingly argues that they are not a currency and should belong to a different asset class entirely. Chapter three discusses ‘Bitcoins Blunders’, one of which I was surprised to learn; that bitcoin can only process 4 transactions per second compared to visas 45,000 – a major hurdle if it is to become the worlds solo currency.

Whilst this topic is highly politicised, the authors do a great job of approaching their writing as objectively as possible. Despite them leaning towards the *‘bubble’* side of the argument, they interestingly acknowledge the potential blockchain can have as a currency in highly specialised domains, for example sending large quantities of money overseas, and in that way provide a rather ambiguous answer to the question *‘Bubble or Revolution?’*.

I would highly recommend this book because it will not only teach you something but, above all else, will be one you most certainly enjoy.
