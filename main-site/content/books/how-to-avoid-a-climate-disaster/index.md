As the human impact on the environment takes centre stage at COP26, this review could not be more timely. Here, Gates shares his expertise on global warming, first outlining the challenges we face as a species before giving his recommendations on how we can get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions.

Gates acknowledges the most effective route to net zero is by ‘electrifying’ human activity – from transportation to steel production – as quickly as possible. Unsurprisingly, he believes accelerated investment in green technology will play a critical role in this transformation. 

In addition to technological advances, Gates believes government policy needs to be aggressive and work in tandem with industry. One interesting suggestion is the introduction of a carbon tax to appropriately account for externalities associated with economic activity, a policy also popularised by Tesla’s Elon Musk.

Finally, I believe this book is perfect for anyone interested in climate change and, more importantly, the technologies that may help us along this journey to net zero.
