Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac, the authors of The Future We Choose- Surviving the Climate Crisis, in many ways could not be more different, they both describe themselves as being born in ‘two different geological periods’. Christiana, born in 1956 at the tail-end of the 12,000 year-long Holocene, a time characterised by a relatively consistently stable climate which enabled our ancestors to flourish. Tom, born in 1977, is one of the first generations of the Anthropocene period, characterised by humanity’s destruction of those conditions that allowed us to thrive. Christiana was born in Costa Rica; Tom in the UK. What they share though is the care and concern for their children. As the UN’s Executive Secretary and Chief Political Strategist respectively, the two played central roles in the historic Paris Agreement of 2015, widely recognised as the most significant step towards staving off runaway climate change since the topic entered mainstream debate. Their shared disappointment in a lack of substantial progress since 2015 motivated them to paint an insightfully detailed yet nihilistic narrative around the future of the home we all share if net GHG emissions continue to rise unabated, whilst global leaders from every stage of economic development continue to squabble. Figueres’ and Carnac’s work acts as a warning, as well as a guidebook on how we can navigate our way away from the worst externalities of climate change, and on a deeper level, finally ‘mature’ as a species.

Readers can’t help but feel pensive about the thought-provoking content that remains pervasive throughout the book. Part 1 bisects the narrative around two contrasting developments from now until the benchmark yea of 2050. A meticulously analysis of the world humanity is heading towards, where warming of the planet is more than 3 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial average global temperature, dominates to begin with and instantly grabs and has the readers’ undivided attention the way someone watches a horror movie for the suspense. Mass migration of people from the more exposed areas, ancient disease outbreaks, a collapse of the healthcare system, deteriorating mental health and political turmoil are to name a few of the painfully realistic themes that humanity will have to take head-on on their path to self-destruction. Or there is another ongoing development we could choose. In a world that is heading to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a compelling picture of how combining present technology, social attitudes and environmental awareness and developing it further creates what the two authors imply as a significantly greater standard of living for us and our children and our grandchildren’s grandchildren. 

Part II and III puts under a meticulous microscope the sticking obstacles we need to hurdle over to progress to this universally better future and gives sound advice on what you can do right now to make as big a difference as possible.

You do not need a background in Environmental Sciences, an Economics or Finance degree or be a budding politician to read this ultimatum-focussed guidebook. It’s simple way of breaking down such an enormously complex, multifaceted issue into clear and concise sections makes it an accessible read for anyone. Described as
