description: "Being someone who seeks to understand the world beyond its face value, Marko Papic’s Geopolitical Alpha nicely fills this void and opens up the reader to the growing importance of political science in the context of investing. Despite many global investors considering geopolitical analysis as exogenous by nature, Marko eloquently proves such ‘hard to predict’ events are made easier to predict when following the material constraints of a situation instead of policymaker preferences. The logic to his framework is based on the premise that “preferences are optional subject to limitations, whereas restrictions are neither optional nor subject to preferences”. "

Being someone who seeks to understand the world beyond its face value, Marko Papic’s Geopolitical Alpha nicely fills this void and opens up the reader to the growing importance of political science in the context of investing. Despite many global investors considering geopolitical analysis as exogenous by nature, Marko eloquently proves such ‘hard to predict’ events are made easier to predict when following the material constraints of a situation instead of policymaker preferences. The logic to his framework is based on the premise that 
>preferences are optional subject to limitations, whereas restrictions are neither optional nor subject to preferences. 

Geopolitical Alpha takes the reader on a journey of political science and the framework for predicting market-moving events. From looking at the reasons why investors should use geopolitical analysis within their investments, to understanding the constraints model used by Marko, this book is riddled with in-depth case studies to back up all the theories and opinions suggested. Moreover, Marko goes beyond the scope of analysis set out by this book, as he describes which political ‘experts’ should and should not be trusted, especially when determining policymakers’ actions. Unlike other political forecasters, Marko also understands that showing how to monetise forecasts in the markets are what the reader wants to know, hence the title of the book referring to Alpha, a term used when you beat the market.  

The main chunk of this book is filled with fundamental analysis of nations within the geopolitical context, with theories such as the Median Voter Theory (MVT) used to decipher exactly how nations make decisions based on different constraints. A key constraint Marko refers to is the MVT, using examples like China to understand if the CCP can and will remain in power when previous authoritarian governments like those in LatAm have failed. Along with this, Marko uses COVID-19 to show how global players like the UK and the US are switching from a Washington Consensus to a Buenos Aires Consensus, as the median voter shifts their preference to a populist leader. Every page is filled with an in-depth analysis of different geopolitical situations, causing the reader to think against the status quo, something Marko clearly apposes. 

The final section of the book is what really makes for such an insightful read, as it pulls everything together to explain exactly how investors can gain a geopolitical edge (alpha) on the markets, with examples from the Euro Crisis, Greece, US/ China and many more. Furthermore, Marko introduces the ‘Net Assessment’ of India, a carefully curated narrative which uses the constraint framework to caution investors on thinking India are the next China, while also offering a way to benchmark when India becomes an investment worth making. 

Having the fortune of speaking with Marko to discuss life and geopolitics, it soon became evident that his down to earth, humorous approach to writing is a true representation of him in real life too, a big reason why I find his work so interesting.  This book is a one-of-a-kind investment framework for understanding geopolitics, a topic scarcely written about in the context of investing.
