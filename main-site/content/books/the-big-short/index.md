description: "The Big Short is a must read for anyone considering working within the finance industry, and a great read for anyone that just wants to learn in easy to understand terms the reasons why the 2008 financial crisis occurred. Granted, it cannot go into all the long running causes, of which there are many, but it does go into the key components of the fractured, deceptive industry of finance. I will not go into those key components here, as I will not be able to explain them as efficiently as the author, but I will go into some of the main characters and key themes. "

The Big Short is a must read for anyone considering working within the finance industry, and a great read for anyone that just wants to learn in easy to understand terms the reasons why the 2008 financial crisis occurred. Granted, it cannot go into all the long running causes, of which there are many, but it does go into the key components of the fractured, deceptive industry of finance. I will not go into those key components here, as I will not be able to explain them as efficiently as the author, but I will go into some of the main characters and key themes. 
The author, Michael Lewis (who also wrote the seminal *Liar's Poker*) tells the story through the lens of four separate investment groups. There is Scion Capital, managed by Dr. Michael Burry. FrontPoint Partners LLC, led by Steve Eisman. Cornwall Capital managed by James Mai and Charlie Ledley. And finally, Greg Lippmann, a bond trader with Deutsche Bank. These characters are all quite different in terms of attitude and presentation, but the unifying thread between all of them is that these investors, working against the contemporary line of thinking, correctly foresaw the collapse of the housing markets in the United States in 2007. Despite their correct predictions, each investor understood the bet they were making; betting against The United States of America.

This book is essential reading for anyone wanting to take the leap into finance for two key reasons. Firstly, it explains the central reasons of how the greatest financial disaster this side of the century came to pass. Secondly, it challenges the notion that the managers and executives that control our major banks and corporations are men and women endowed with a god like wisdom, whose actions and motivations must never be challenged. This is an important lesson. Always think for yourself, and question other people's decision making. Even the smartest people in the room can make mistakes. 

Ultimately The Big Short is just a very well written book. It's fast paced, punchy, and full of vivid characters. All in all, I would give this book 5/5.
