Brett King’s Bank 4.0 is a thought-provoking assessment on the current state of global banking and its many flaws. A flurry of anecdotes from the likes of Jack Ma’s Ant Financial, coupled with a variety of other futuristic examples, demonstrate the imperfections in the rigid Western banking system. Furthermore, Bank 4.0 then describes some of the disruptive technologies, from Artificial Intelligence to Blockchain, that are transforming banking as we know it.

Brett is without doubt a visionary. He believes the future of banking will be instant, smart and integrated into our daily lives. An interesting example described in the book, is the embedding of smart assistants like Siri and Alexa into advanced budgeting tools. These digital assistants will have such a deep understanding of spending patterns, they may message as someone approaches a Starbucks, highlighting their budgeting goals, before suggesting a cheaper alternative. It is this obsessive focus on customer experience, Brett believes, will be the deciding characteristic for surviving firms.

In conclusion, for those in the early stages of their banking career, this book offers a fascinating insight into what your future job may look like.
