In light of the recent news breaking report published by the ICIJ, Pandora Papers, tax havens are suddenly back at the forefront of political debate, much like they were in 2016 when the ICIJ also published the Panama Papers. This is where Nicholas Shaxon comes in, a British journalist known to be at the forefront of investigating offshore finance. Throughout his book, Treasure Islands, Nicholas does an exceptional job at demystifying the oh-so-complicated offshore banking scene, with surprising insights at every turn of the page. 

Although the world of offshore finance has been riddled with secrecy, complexity and smoke-filled rooms, Nicholas has been able to dive deep into the unknown to uncover some of the most shocking truths of the decade. From well-known tax havens like Panama and the Cayman Islands to less talked about havens like London and Delaware, treasure islands will raise your blood pressure and make you question global leaders’ integrity. Names such as David Cameron, Rupert Murdoch and pretty much every other multimillionaire/ billionaire get put in the spotlight and proved to evade taxes through loops holes and poor financial infrastructures in little islands, known as havens. 

Despite being published in 2012, this book has aged exceptionally well due to the lack of action taken by governments to eliminate the growing use of tax havens to store wealth. Also, the updated version has a nicely written chapter on the Panama Papers, meaning you don’t need to read the papers yourself.

For anyone interested in the unknown world of tax havens and offshore finance, this book is a must read. The easy to understand language allows readers to get to grips with the severity of the situation without being overwhelmed. As the Panama Papers and the Pandora Papers have shown, even the least corrupt countries in the world participate in offshore banking, so get ready to be shocked and angered when reading.
