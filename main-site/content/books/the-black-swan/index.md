However, at the turn of the century, an explorer discovered a black swan. This new piece of evidence, this single observation, completely disproves the original theory and, retrospectively, made it obvious that black swans could exist."

The term ‘Black Swan’ originates from the Western ideology in the 1600’s that *all swans are white* where the assumption was validated every time a white swan was seen. However, at the turn of the century, an explorer discovered a black swan. This new piece of evidence, this single observation, completely disproves the original theory and, retrospectively, made it obvious that black swans could exist.

The central idea of this book focuses on ‘black swan events’, that are highly improbable, have catastrophic consequences and seemed obvious in hindsight... a recent pandemic springs to mind. While at times Talebs tone is arrogant, his ideas are nothing short of spectacular. Furthermore, for those who, like me, enjoy the quantitative side of finance, the appendices are plastered with formulas and figures that eloquently explain the theory discussed in the main body of the book. 

To truly understand the potential upside of investments, and decisions more generally, it is imperative you are aware of the downside. This book is not only a fantastic starting point to begin that journey but will change the way you see the world, which to me, is the mark of an excellent read!
